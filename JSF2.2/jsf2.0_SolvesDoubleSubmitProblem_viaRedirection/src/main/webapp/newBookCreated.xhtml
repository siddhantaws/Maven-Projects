        <h1>A new book has been created</h1>
        This example shows a typical double-submit problem.
        If you refresh this page, the new post request gets
        generated again causing double-submit problem.
        This occurs because the URL still points to 
        newBook.xhtml even though the contents of this
        page is from newBookCreated.xhtml.
        
        As an experiment, just refresh this page a couple
        of times and then go to the BOOK table of the database
        and you will see the multiple rows are created.
        
        The solution to this problem is doing a redirect
        so that even the URL points to the newBookCreated.xhtml.
